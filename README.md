- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Wolffenstein87
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in learning Kali Linux basics but also in building and using different projects with Raspberry Pis.
- ðŸŒ± Currently I am working on a diy outdoor notebook that is small and durable. My goal is to make it as inexpensive as 
possible whilst making it as useful as it gets. This includes built in communications, gps, video recording (alos night vision) etc..
